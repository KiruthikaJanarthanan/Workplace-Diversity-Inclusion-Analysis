# **Diversity & Inclusion Analysis**

### Overview of the Dashboard

This project analyzes workforce diversity, promotions, and retention trends to identify disparities in hiring, career growth, and employee turnover. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion  while improving employee retention and career progression.

### Data Collection

As a part of Virtual Internship with PwC Switzerland, I was provided with a dataset to complete this project.

### Data Preparation and transformation

Once the data is loaded in Power Bi, Data cleaning and transformation is done in Power Query.

- Handle missing values (e.g., performance ratings and job levels).
- Standardize categorical values.
- Convert necessary columns to proper data types.

### Data Visualization

Clean and processed data is loaded to Report View in Power BI for analysis.
